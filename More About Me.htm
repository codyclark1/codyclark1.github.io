      <h1>For a job, In my opinion, I think selflessness is a big aspect of a good employee, for their colleagues and clients. A person that puts customers and teammates first benefits the whole, and is a really integral piece of a functioning group.

In regards to work, self-discipline, work ethic, and perfectionism is very important to deliver outstanding service, especially in a consulting firm. Not only that, but kindness and hospitality goes a long way to ensure positive relationships with clients to keep them coming back and sharing positive feedback with others.

These are kind of blanket terms, but I think they really adhere to what every Employee should possess in the work place, and it's what I really strive to be in such.</h1>
